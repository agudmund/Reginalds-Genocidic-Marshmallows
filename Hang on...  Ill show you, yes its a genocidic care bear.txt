Hang on...  Ill show you, yes its a sad marshmallow carebear
It just did something
So like, first

Marhmallow cthulu started attackimg all the cities
All the people were afraid, and their homes being destroyed

And marhmallow god was away on business

So the people sent an army to f8ght marshmallow cthulu
Which caused even greater destruction

Many battles between the armies and marshmallows were fought

This led to the actual apocalypse arriving and civilization as we knew ended

But reginald knew what he had to do
He stepped up, and fought both cthulu and the robot armies

Buy it wasnt until aftet he won the war, that he looked around and saw that even though he had become a mighty champion, and saved mother earyh from destruction
He no longer had other marshmallows to play with
And this made reginald sad

At one point, reginald had to make a choice, to genocide everyome he had ever loved, because they had taken up annihilating mankind, so it was either to watch everyone die, or end the war and forever be considered the only remaining evil, from a war he did not fight.  Reginald has seen some things, but he survived them all.

Reginald is such a misunderstood marshmallow care bear, he just wants everything to be a little sugary, the legend tells that he still to this day collects the broken marshmallows from the war, and hands them out as sprinkles on ice cream for people who need an extra smile in their day
